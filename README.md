# html5-canvas-advert
An example of using the HTML5 canvas to render a mobile-friendly animated advert.

# The animation
At Now Native we are working on some cool ad intelligence stuff.

To test things out, we're running an ad campaign on the internet - not to drum up brand awareness but to catalog the technical process of serving an ad.

Because we are a next-gen group of lads, I thought it would be a good idea to make our advert next-gen too.

Enjoy!

# Learnings
I've been working on WebGL animations for my Oculus Rift in my spare time. It was fun applying things like requestAnimationFrame() to a 2d canvas.

Animating is still quite complicated as you have to write a lot of the frame logic yourself - it's made me realise how great CSS transitions are, and frameworks like three.js.

So thanks to those guys for making them exist.
